                            <b>Privacy Policy of Code Cruise</b><br>

                            At Code Cruise, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy
                            outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you visit our
                            website or use our services.

                            <br><br><b>Collection of Personal Information:</b><br>

                            When you visit our website, we may collect certain personal information, such as your name,
                            email address, and contact details, when you voluntarily provide them to us through forms or
                            inquiries. Additionally, we may collect non-personal information, such as your IP address,
                            browser type, and device information, for analytical purposes.

                            <br><br><b>Use of Personal Information:</b><br>

                            We use the personal information we collect to provide and improve our services, respond to
                            inquiries, and communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. We may
                            also use your information to personalize your experience, analyze trends, and ensure the
                            security of our website.

                            <br><br><b>Disclosure of Personal Information:</b><br>

                            We may share your personal information with third-party service providers who assist us in
                            operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you. We may also disclose your
                            information when required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of
                            others.

                            <br><br><b>Data Retention:</b><br>

                            We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
                            outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
                            law.

                            <br><br><b>Security:</b><br>

                            We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information and
                            implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to prevent unauthorized
                            access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

                            <br><br><b>Your Rights:</b><br>

                            You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information at any time. You
                            may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the instructions
                            provided in such communications.
